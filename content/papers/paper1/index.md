summary: "This paper proposes a new metholody to estimate the elasticity of substitution between pollutant and non-pollutant energy for the US. With a point estimate of 0.6, much closer to 1 than previously thought, the energy transition will be slower and more painful. Subsidies are not a sufficient policy tool when used alone."

##### Abstract

We propose a new methodology to estimate the aggregate elasticity of substitution between pollutant and
non-pollutant energy. Exploiting the variation in US statesâ€™ energy mixes, we find that the elasticity is closer to 1 than
previously thought. Our estimates preclude subsidies as the sole policy tool to enact the long-run energy transition. We
also propose a model that connects aggregate and sectoral elasticities, and find the average energy end-user elasticity
to be 0.72. We also conclude that aggregate elasticities do not necessarily rise with the clean energy share. Ultimately,
transportation and electricity generation are the main drags on the aggregate elasticity.
