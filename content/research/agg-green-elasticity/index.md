summary: "This paper proposes a new methodology to estimate the elasticity of substitution between pollutant and non-pollutant energy for the US. With a point estimate of 0.59, much closer to unity than previously thought, the energy transition will be more painful and uneven. It further suggests that subsidies are not a sufficient policy tool when used alone."

### Abstract

We develop a methodology to estimate the aggregate elasticity of substitution between pollutant and non-pollutant energy. Exploiting variation in US states' energy mixes, we estimate an elasticity of 0.59 --- statistically closer to unity and significantly smaller than prior studies suggest. This implies that subsidies alone may be insufficient to achieve a long-run energy transition. A model linking aggregate and sectoral elasticities yields an average end-user elasticity of 0.94, with the transportation sector emerging as a key constraint on overall substitutability. We show that increases in clean energy shares do not significantly raise the aggregate elasticity unless sectoral elasticities rise.

Notes: The figure plots two series for the US: the log-difference in average energy prices between pollutant and non-pollutant sources, and the log-difference in energy consumption between clean and dirty energy. Both series are normalized to 100 in 2010 prior to the log transformation. As a proxy for clean energy prices, we use onshore wind LCOE estimates from International Renewable Energy Agency (2024); analogous results using photovoltaic estimates are shown in figure 13. All prices are adjusted for inflation.
