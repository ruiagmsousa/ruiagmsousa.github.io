	\organization{The Aggregate Green Elasticity of Substitution {\small (Draft Upon Request)}}{}{}
	
	\begin{cvabstract}
	We develop a methodology to estimate the aggregate elasticity of substitution between pollutant and non-pollutant energy. Leveraging variation in US states’ energy mixes, we estimate an elasticity of 0.6 - statistically much closer to unity than prior studies - implying subsidies alone are insufficient for a long-run energy transition. A model linking aggregate and sectoral elasticities yields an average end-user elasticity of 0.72. We show that increasing the clean energy share without raising micro-elasticities reduces aggregate elasticity. Finally, the transportation sector significantly constrains overall substitutability in the US.
